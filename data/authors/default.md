A constant learner who enjoys experimenting, experimenting with new technology, and networking with individuals from all countries and races.I have a solid background in computer engineering and mathematics. The majority of my knowledge is in HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, NODE, MONGODB, SQL, PHP, AND the Microsoft office suite. I'm a quick study and am ready to quickly pick up new abilities if they are required for the project. I like discovering new technologies. I wish to continue my post-graduation career.I am now learning MERN Stack Development, and because web development was my major focus in high school, I would be happy to learn new things about WEB 3. I am a web development lead at Club Ide, and I also hold a number of web development certifications.
